# Security Policy

Thank you for taking the time to responsibly disclose potential security issues. This document explains how to report a vulnerability and what to expect.

## Reporting a vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please email us at [oliverlebaigue@gmail.com](mailto:oliverlebaigue@gmail.com). In your email, please include the following information:

- Subject line: [Pet Paths] Security report
- Short summary of the issue
- Step-by-step reproduction (minimal steps)
- Proof-of-concept (safe, non-destructive)
- Affected URL(s) and timeframe
- Your contact details (optional)

## Safe handling and expectations

When reporting a vulnerability, please adhere to the following guidelines:

- Do not exploit the issue beyond proof-of-concept. Do not access, modify, or delete data that is not yours.
- Avoid disclosing user personal data when demonstrating a bug; redact private information.
- You will receive an acknowledgment within 72 hours.
- We aim to triage and respond with remediation guidance or next steps within 14 calendar days.
- Critical fixes will be prioritized and coordinated with the reporter where practical.

## Scope

The scope of this security policy includes:

- **In-scope**: Web frontend pages, Firebase Realtime Database references, admin UI features, and public endpoints used by the frontend.
- **Out-of-scope**: Third-party services, browsers, platform vulnerabilities outside the project code, or private hosting infrastructure not controlled by this repository.

## Severity and disclosure

We follow a coordinated disclosure process:

- Public disclosure will only happen after the issue has been fixed or mutually agreed timelines have elapsed.
- Reporters who request it will be credited in advisories unless they request anonymity.

## Safe-harbor

Reporters acting in good faith to help secure the project will be treated with respect and will not face legal action from the project maintainers for the tested activity (within the scope defined above).

## Handling of personal data

The repository contains minimal client-side references to a Firebase project; this project stores user-submitted data. If your report involves personal data exposure, please indicate that in your report so we can prioritize remediation.

## PGP / encrypted reporting

If you prefer encrypted reporting, please request a PGP key at [oliverlebaigue@gmail.com](mailto:oliverlebaigue@gmail.com), and we will provide a key for secure communication.

## Contact

For any questions or concerns, please contact us at [oliverlebaigue@gmail.com](mailto:oliverlebaigue@gmail.com).

Thank you for helping keep Pet Paths safer.
