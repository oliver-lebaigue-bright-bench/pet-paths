Pet Paths is a lightweight, static web application for sharing dog walks, local pet profiles, and short pet-related posts.  
It is designed to be simple, privacy-respecting, and easily hosted on any static platform.

This repository contains **only the frontend**. Optional dynamic features use **Firebase Realtime Database**.

---

## Overview

Pet Paths provides:
- Walk sharing  
- Playdate listings  
- Short pet-net feed posts  
- Pet profile pages  
- Optional login and account linkage  
- Basic admin tools  

Everything runs using plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript — no frameworks or build system required.

---

## Firebase Notes

The frontend includes a Firebase configuration for dynamic features.

Important notes:
- Client-side Firebase keys **are not secret**  
- Never commit Firebase service-account credentials  
- Update your own Firebase config if self-hosting  
- Ensure secure Firebase Realtime Database Rules in your project
